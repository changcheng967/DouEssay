## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Not Security Issues)

1. **Supabase Dependency**
   - System requires Supabase credentials
   - If Supabase is unavailable, system won't work
   - Mitigation: Proper error handling in place

2. **LanguageTool Grammar Check**
   - External library for grammar checking
   - Graceful degradation if unavailable
   - Non-critical feature

3. **NLTK Downloads**
   - Requires internet for first-time setup
   - Data downloaded to local cache
   - Minimal security risk

## 🔐 Recommendations for Deployment

### For Production Use

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export SUPABASE_URL=<your_secure_url>
   export SUPABASE_KEY=<your_secure_key>
   ```

2. **Server Configuration**
   - Use HTTPS for all traffic
   - Implement rate limiting at server level
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Regular dependency updates

3. **Access Control**
   - Ensure license validation is working
   - Monitor for abuse patterns
   - Implement IP-based rate limiting if needed

4. **Monitoring**
   - Log all license validation attempts
   - Track usage patterns
   - Alert on suspicious activity
   - Regular security audits
