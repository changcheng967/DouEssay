complexity_bonus = vocab_sophistication * 2 + rhetorical_techniques * 1.5 + 
                   argument_strength * 2 + emotional_engagement * 0.5 + 
                   evidence_coherence * 0.5

penalties = unsupported_claims * 0.05 + logical_fallacies * 0.02

final_score = (base_score + complexity_bonus - penalties) * grade_multiplier + quality_bonus
```

#### Content Scoring Enhancement (v7.0.0)
```
base_content = (thesis + examples + analysis) / 3
argument_bonus = argument_strength * 0.15
rhetorical_bonus = technique_score * 0.10
vocab_bonus = sophistication_score * 0.10
emotional_bonus = engagement_score * 0.05  # NEW
coherence_bonus = coherence_score * 0.05   # NEW
fallacy_penalty = logical_fallacies * 0.02  # NEW

content_score = (base_content + bonuses - penalties) * 10
```
