```
- **Three-Tier Depth Model**:
  - **Shallow**: Generic words (good, bad, important, nice)
  - **Moderate**: Analytical words (beneficial, problematic, significant)
  - **Deep**: Sophisticated vocabulary (multifaceted, nuanced, paradoxical, systemic)
- **Weighted Scoring**: Shallow=0.3, Moderate=0.6, Deep=1.0
- **Depth Ratings**: Shallow (<0.5), Moderate (0.5-0.75), Deep (‚â•0.75)
- **Sophistication Detection**: Identifies essays with 2+ deep indicators

**Educational Impact**: 
Students learn to move beyond surface-level analysis into deeper, more nuanced argumentation. The system recognizes and rewards sophisticated thinking patterns.

#### Evidence Relevance Scoring (NEW)
```python
assess_evidence_relevance(text) -> Dict
```
- **Direct Relevance Indicators** (40% weight):
  - "specifically," "directly," "explicitly"

**Educational Impact**:
Encourages students to use timely, contextually appropriate evidence rather than generic or outdated examples.

```
- **Automatic Paragraph Classification**:
  - Introduction (thesis indicators present)
  - Argument (supporting points with evidence)

  - Conclusion (summarizes and synthesizes)
- **Structure Visualization**: Each paragraph mapped by type and word count
- **Quality Scoring**:
  - Clear Introduction: +25%
  - Clear Conclusion: +25%
  - Counter-Argument Present: +15%
