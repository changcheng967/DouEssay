## 🔧 Algorithm Enhancements

### Content Scoring (v7.0.0)

**Updated Formula**:
```
base_content = (thesis + examples + analysis) / 3

# v6.0.0 bonuses
argument_bonus = argument_strength * 0.15
rhetorical_bonus = technique_score * 0.10
vocab_bonus = sophistication_score * 0.10

# v7.0.0 NEW bonuses
emotional_bonus = engagement_score * 0.05  # NEW
coherence_bonus = coherence_score * 0.05   # NEW

# v7.0.0 NEW penalties
unsupported_penalty = unsupported_claims * 0.05
fallacy_penalty = logical_fallacies * 0.02  # NEW

content_score = (base_content + bonuses - penalties) * 10
```

### Overall Scoring (v7.0.0)

**Updated Formula**:
```
base_score = (content*0.35 + structure*0.25 + application*0.25 + grammar*0.15) * 10

complexity_bonus = 
    vocab_sophistication * 2 +
    rhetorical_techniques * 1.5 +
    argument_strength * 2 +
    emotional_engagement * 0.5 +  # NEW
    evidence_coherence * 0.5       # NEW

length_bonus = tiered (up to +5)
grade_multiplier = 0.98 to 1.05
quality_bonus = +2 fundamentals, +1.5 mastery

final_score = (base_score + complexity_bonus + length_bonus) * 
              grade_multiplier + quality_bonus
```
