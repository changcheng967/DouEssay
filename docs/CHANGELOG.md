## [10.1.0] - 2025-10-31

### 🔧 Hotfix Release - TypeError Fix & Schema Validation

This release addresses a critical `TypeError: string indices must be integers` bug in `save_draft()` and implements comprehensive schema validation and error handling as specified in the v10.1.0 fix & improvement report.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Critical TypeError Fix
- **Fixed `save_draft()` crash**: Added safe `extract_rubric_level()` helper function that never raises
- **Root Cause**: v9.0.0 changed `grade_essay()` to return `rubric_level` as string from Neural Rubric, but `save_draft()` expected v8.0.0 dict format with `level` and `description` keys
- **Solution**: Normalized at source and added defensive extraction throughout codebase

#### Defensive Coding Implementation
- **`extract_rubric_level(result)`**: New helper function that safely extracts rubric level from any format
  - Handles dict format with 'level' and 'description' keys
  - Handles string format (e.g., "Level 3")
  - Handles JSON-stringified dict format
  - Returns fallback dict on errors (never raises)
- **`normalize_grading_result(raw_result)`**: Ensures consistent schema across all grading outputs
  - Canonicalizes various result formats
  - Adds metadata for debugging
  - Returns safe fallback on errors
- **`get_level_description(level)`**: Maps Ontario level strings to standard descriptions

### ✨ Added - Robustness Features

#### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive try-catch in `process_essay()`**: Catches and logs grading errors
- **User-friendly error messages**: No stack traces exposed to users
- **Error logging**: All malformed results logged with context for engineering triage
- **Draft save protection**: Errors in draft saving don't crash the entire request

#### Logging Infrastructure
- **Structured logging**: Added `logging` module with INFO level by default
- **Error tracking**: Logs include type information, excerpts, and full context
- **Format**: `%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`

### 🔧 Changed

#### Schema Normalization
- **`grade_essay()` return value**: Now returns `rubric_level` as dict with `level`, `description`, and `score` keys
  - Maintains v9.0.0 Neural Rubric string internally
  - Converts to canonical dict format before returning
  - Ensures backward compatibility with v8.0.0 consumers
- **`generate_ontario_teacher_feedback()`**: Enhanced to safely handle both dict and string rubric formats
  - Extracts level and description safely
  - Logs warnings for unexpected formats
  - Falls back gracefully

#### Draft Storage
- **Enhanced `save_draft()`**: 
  - Uses `extract_rubric_level()` for safe extraction
  - Stores `raw_result_excerpt` (first 200 chars) for debugging
  - Never crashes on malformed input

### 📚 Documentation

#### Version Updates
- **VERSION**: Updated from "10.0.0" to "10.1.0"
- **VERSION_NAME**: Updated from "Project Apex" to "Project Apex Hotfix"
- **UI Headers**: Updated all interface text to reflect v10.1.0

- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working even with partial data
- **Comprehensive validation**: Result schemas validated at multiple layers
- **Error recovery**: Users can retry after errors without losing context

#### Monitoring Readiness
- **Structured logging**: Easy to parse for monitoring systems
- **Error context**: Includes user_id, essay_length, result excerpts
- **Debugging support**: Raw result excerpts preserved in draft storage

### 🔄 Backwards Compatibility

#### Zero Breaking Changes
- ✅ All v10.0.0 and v9.0.0 function signatures maintained
- ✅ Existing license keys work unchanged
- ✅ All return fields preserved and enhanced
- ✅ UI remains consistent
- ✅ No database schema changes

#### Safe Upgrade Path
- **Automatic normalization**: Old-format results automatically converted
- **Fallback behavior**: Missing data replaced with safe defaults
- **No data migration needed**: Existing drafts remain compatible

### 🎯 Issue Resolution

This release fully addresses the v10.1.0 Fix & Improvement Report requirements:
1. ✅ Defensive coding to prevent crashes
2. ✅ Schema normalization at source (grade_essay)
3. ✅ Safe extraction helpers
4. ✅ Comprehensive error handling
5. ✅ Structured logging for triage
6. ✅ User-friendly error messages
