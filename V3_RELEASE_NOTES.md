- **Academic Detection**: Identifies formal vs. educational contexts
- **Safe Replacement**: Whole-word matching prevents partial substitutions
- **Consistent Alternatives**: Uses most formal option in academic contexts

**Result**: Teaches appropriate word choice through context-aware examples.

Monitor word quality evolution across drafts:
- **Dual Progress Charts**: Overall score + vocabulary quality
- **4 Key Metrics**: Word count, vocab score, reflection score, generic word count
- **Improvement Indicators**: Shows ↑ +5 or ↓ -3 between drafts
- **20-Point Vocab Scale**: Measures sophisticated vs. generic word usage

**Result**: Students see concrete evidence of vocabulary growth over time.

#### 7. **Self-Reflection Prompts** 💭
